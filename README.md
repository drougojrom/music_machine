Music station with maxima.js

<p>This is my code from one of the courses. I`ve used maxim.js for the first time and it works.</p>

<p>This project is really far from an end, but I`ll publish it here, so I could return to it later.
Up to this moment I didn`t use any packages and also didn`t remove insecure or autopublish.</p>

//I have already noticed some bugs in it - suddenly a scroll with speed doesn`t work on Chrome.
